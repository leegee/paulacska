* Give your images titles in English, but replace spaces with _underscores_: "Things That Live In My Head" becomes `Things_that_live_in_my_head`.
* The largest size each image should be 900 pixels. This is the choice of Magnum for their 2014 public website without watermarks.
* For every 900 pixel image, create one whose longest side is 200 pixels, and save it alongside the original, but with `_thumb` before the file extension, like this: `my_picture_thumb.jpg`. Please maintain all other aspects of the filename, including the file extension.
* Log in to `ftp://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@ftp.paulacska.com`
* Chose a name for your portfolio, with underscores instead of spaces, and create a directory with that name within `/www`. Upload your images to that directory.
* For the homepage slideshow images, upload to `/www/slideshow/`.
